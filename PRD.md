# Fenix Fit Finder — Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.1
**Domain:** wearfenix.com
**Stack:** React + TypeScript · Vercel (free) · Anthropic Claude API
**Monetization:** Amazon Associates affiliate links
**Status:** Pre-build

---

## 1. Product Overview

Fenix Fit Finder is an AI-powered gym outfit recommender. Users answer 5 quick questions about their workout style, budget, gender, style preference, and fit preference. Claude AI reads a curated catalog of 30–50 products and returns a complete outfit — one top, one bottom, one pair of shoes, and one accessory — each with a product name, price, one-line reason, and a "Shop This" button linked to an Amazon Associates affiliate URL.

**Core value loop:**
User answers quiz → AI picks 3 distinct outfits from catalog → User browses outfits via tabs → User clicks "Shop This" → Amazon purchase → Affiliate commission

---

### Non-Goals (V1)

- Admin dashboard
- Payment processing
- Email capture or CRM
- Multiple affiliate networks (Amazon only for MVP)

---

- All outfits still respect the user's gender, budget, workout type, style, and fit filters

**API response schema:**
```typescript
interface OutfitRecommendations {
  outfits: OutfitRecommendation[]; // always 3
}
```

**Timeout:** Increased from 15s to 25s to account for the larger AI response.

## 6. Claude AI Integration

### 6.1 API Call

**File:** `src/utils/claude.ts`
**Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6`
**Trigger:** User clicks "Get My Fit" on final quiz question

```typescript
async function getOutfitRecommendation(
  answers: QuizAnswers,
  products: Product[]
): Promise<OutfitRecommendation>
```

### 6.2 System Prompt

```
You are a gym outfit stylist for Fenix Fit Finder.
You always respond with valid JSON only. No markdown. No explanation outside the JSON.
```

### 6.3 User Prompt Template

```
User profile:
- Workout type: {answers.workout}
- Budget per item: {answers.budget}
- Style vibe: {answers.style}
- Gender: {answers.gender}
- Fit preference: {answers.fit}

Product catalog:
{JSON.stringify(products)}

Create 3 complete, distinct gym outfits for this user. Each outfit must include exactly
one top, one bottom, one pair of shoes, and one accessory.

Rules:
- Every product must match the user's gender (or be unisex)
- No product price may exceed the user's budget ceiling
- Prioritize workout type and style vibe as primary filters
- Each outfit must feel cohesive and complete on its own
- The 3 outfits should offer real variety (different color stories, silhouettes, or vibe
  intensity) while still fitting the user's filters
- Never reuse the same product ID across more than one outfit

Respond ONLY with this exact JSON structure:
{
  "outfits": [
    {
      "top":       { "id": "...", "reason": "one sentence why" },
      "bottom":    { "id": "...", "reason": "one sentence why" },
      "shoes":     { "id": "...", "reason": "one sentence why" },
      "accessory": { "id": "...", "reason": "one sentence why" }
    },
    { ... },
    { ... }
  ]
}
```

### 6.4 Error Handling
- If Claude returns malformed JSON → catch parse error → show "Something went wrong. Try again." with retry button
- If no product matches a category → fall back to the highest-rated product in that category regardless of filters
- Network timeout (>10s) → show error state

### 6.5 Cost Estimate
- Input tokens per call: ~1,500–2,000 (catalog + prompt)
- Output tokens per call: ~600 (3× the original single-outfit response)
- Cost per call: ~$0.00 at Groq free tier (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
- 1,000 users/month = effectively $0 on Groq free tier
